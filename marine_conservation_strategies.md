## Marine Protected Areas (MPAs):
 - Establishing MPAs is a fundamental strategy to conserve marine biodiversity. These designated zones restrict human activities such as fishing, mining, and shipping to protect sensitive ecosystems and allow
   marine species to thrive.

## Sustainable Fisheries Management:
 - Implementing science-based fisheries management practices helps prevent overfishing and ensures the long term sustainability of fish stocks. This involves setting catch limits, enforcing regulations, and
   promoting ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management.
